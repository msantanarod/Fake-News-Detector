# Fake News Detector

Hi, welcome to this project!

A fake news is piece of false information presented as a new with the goal to damage the reputation of a person or company. Fake news have always existed in history, but in the last years, their relevance have increased due to social media. 

This is why, I decided to build a fake news detector using machine learning in order to detect them.

ðŸ“ˆ Data: For this project we will use 2 datasets from Kaggel that we can find in the following link: [Fake and real news]([https://www.example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)). The dataset "True.csv" has 21417 rows x 4 columns and the dataset "fake.csv" has 23481 rows Ã— 4 columns.

ðŸ”¬ Methodology: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
